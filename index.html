                Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. 
                No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she 
                felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her 
                little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of 
                goodies. Then she remembered her mother’s promise and, 
                slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little 
                crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was 
                that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, 
                and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim 
                going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a “Merry 
                Christmas,” and bade her see what was under her pillow. 
                A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture 
                inside, and a few words written by their mother, which 
                made their one present very precious in their eyes. 
                Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and find their 
                little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, 
                and all sat looking at and talking about them, while 
                the east grew rosy with the coming day.

                The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it 
                took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it 
                very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the 
                biggest one, but after he had called, said something 
                funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over 
                old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of 
                him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that 
                they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy 
                of accepting favors which they could not return. But, 
                after a while, they found that he considered them the 
                benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful 
                he was for Mrs. March’s motherly welcome, their cheerful 
                society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of 
                theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged 
                kindnesses without stopping to think which was the 
                greater.
